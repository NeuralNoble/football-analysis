# Football Analysis Using Computer Vision
This project uses Fine tuned yolov8 Model to do analysis on players and refrees and ball on the field . it tracks player and draws an ellipse at the foot of the player. it also tracks balls and draws a triangle to show the position of the ball at the current moment 
and also draws the triangle over the player who has the ball at the moment and also determines the speed of the player and distance traveled by the player . 

## Future goals
- goal detection
- draw the trajectory of the ball for better accuracy
- detect key moments during the gameplay
